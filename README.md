Object detection using the YOLO neural network and CUDA hardware and software architecture

An experiment was conducted on the use of CUDA and tensor kernels in problems of object detection and recognition.
This example uses a pre-trained object detection network such as YOLO v3 trained on the COCO dataset.
Requires NVIDIAÂ® GPU with CUDA support and compatible driver. 
I used Emgu.CV.runtime.windows.cuda version 4.4.0.4099 and all other Emgu.CV packages version 4.4.0.4099 (versions must match).
